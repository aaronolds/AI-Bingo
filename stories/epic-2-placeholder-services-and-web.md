# Epic 2 — Services and Web App (placeholder)

## Summary
This epic will cover building the domain, data layer, API features (including SignalR), and the web UI/admin UI.

## Global Rule
Use the official Aspire CLI + docs for orchestration steps; keep repo docs limited to “install CLI, run CLI”.

## Next Stories (to be authored)
- Domain modeling + validation
- Persistence (EF Core + provider selection)
- API endpoints + SignalR hub(s)
- Web app UI + admin UI
- Observability (OpenTelemetry)
- Deployment packaging (Aspire-supported workflow)
