# Stories

This folder contains GitHub-ready user stories in Markdown.

## Conventions
- File naming: `epic-<n>-story-<n>-<slug>.md`
- Format: **User Story**, **Scope**, **Acceptance Criteria**, **Implementation Tasks**, **Notes/Dependencies**

## How to publish to GitHub Issues (optional)
If you want, I can generate a script (or `gh` CLI commands) that creates one GitHub Issue per file and links them under a GitHub Project/Epic label.
