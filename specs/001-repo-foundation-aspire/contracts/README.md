# Contracts (N/A): Repo Foundation & Aspire Setup

**Feature**: specs/001-repo-foundation-aspire/spec.md
**Date**: 2025-12-20

No API endpoints or external integration contracts are specified for this feature.

This feature’s deliverables are:
- Repository structure and build/test behavior
- Aspire AppHost orchestration wiring (AppHost + Postgres + Redis + API)
- CI guardrails enforcing `.slnx` and central package management conventions

When API endpoints are introduced (Epic 2+), this directory should contain OpenAPI (or other)
contracts aligned to the user stories for those features.
